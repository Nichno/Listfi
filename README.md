# listfi

`listfi` is a simple shell script that searches for a specific word within all files in a directory and its subdirectories. If the word is found, it displays the location. If not, it logs the search term in a log file.

## Features

- Recursively searches through directories and subdirectories.
- Displays the file path where the search term is found.
- Logs a message if the search term is not found in any files.

## Requirements

- Unix-like operating system with a shell (e.g., Linux, macOS).
- `grep` utility (commonly available in Unix-like OS).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Nichno/listfi.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory:

    ```sh
    cd listfi
    ```

3. Make the script executable:

    ```sh
    chmod +x listfi
    ```

## Usage

Run the script with the search term as an argument:

```sh
./listfi search_term
```

Replace `search_term` with the word you want to search for.

### Example

```sh
./listfi example
```

If the term `example` is found in any files, the script will output the file paths. If the term is not found, it will log a message in `search_results.log`.

## Log File

If the search term is not found in any files, the script logs the following message in `search_results.log`:

```
Search term 'search_term' not found in any files.
```

This log file is created in the same directory where the script is executed.
